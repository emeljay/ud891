# Udacity Web Accessibility

Hello! This is a repo for the workshop Web Accessiblity: Making screen-reader
friendly websites at GHC 2018. As this is intended for use only for this
workshop, we will not be maintaining this, but we encourage you to check out
the Udacity Web Accessibility course.

## Running the examples

Most of the examples can just have their `index.html` dragged into the browser
